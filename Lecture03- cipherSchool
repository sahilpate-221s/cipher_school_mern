In this video they have explained how internet technologies work, focusing on the interaction between frontend and backend components using Facebook as an example.
When the person types www.facebook.com on his laptop, it resolves to an IP address hosting Facebook’s frontend, which sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the site. 
Persons login details are sent to the backend server for verification against a database. If correct, the backend server informs the frontend server to proceed; otherwise, an error message is sent. 
The speaker introduces the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and emphasizes the importance of these interactions for developing web applications. 
Additionally, the Domain Name System (DNS) resolves domain names to IP addresses, facilitating the connection between the user’s device and the server.
This overview sets the stage for a deeper exploration of web development technologies.
